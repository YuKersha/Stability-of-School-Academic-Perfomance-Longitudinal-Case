# Examining School Effectiveness Through Longitudinal Analysis in Tyumen Region (Russia)

A school's effectiveness is the ultimate measure of its success in imparting knowledge and skills to its students. Over the years, many researchers and practitioners have tried to identify the factors that differentiate successful schools from their less successful counterparts. However, in the Russian tradition of school effectiveness research, effectiveness is not usually viewed as a measurable characteristic of a school, i.e., its "contribution" to student performance.

Our study aims to bridge this gap in knowledge and analyze the effectiveness of Russian schools exploring stability in academic performance over five years. Specifically, we address these research questions:

How stable is a school's academic performance across years in Russian and math?
How much of the individual performance variance can be attributed to the school?
Is there a difference in the stability of academic performance across schools with varying levels of socioeconomic status (SES)?
To find answers to these questions, we (IOE HSE) conducted a longitudinal study in the Tyumen region of Russia in 2019. We collected data from all participants in the educational process, including principals, students, teachers, and parents. Our study included over 85% of all schools in the region, with a total of 287 participating schools from 25 municipalities. We collected data on school personnel, resources, and infrastructure in 2019, along with graduates' performance on the unified state exams for five years (2015-2019).

Our study sheds light on the effectiveness of Russian schools and can inform evidence-based policy-making to improve educational outcomes. By analyzing school effectiveness and stability in academic performance, we aim to contribute to the development of effective education policies. We hope that our study will inspire more research in this area.

The results of the research were presented at the CIES 2021 international conference, where we had the opportunity to share our findings with other experts in the field.
